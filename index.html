                 <p>There are many reasons why love is important.</p>
                 <p>One main reason Love is important is that one of the most powerful feelings.  Love is intangible.  You cannot touch it, smell it, or taste it.  You can only see and feel Love in your mind and soul. When a mother or father holds their child for the first time, your first kiss, finding your passion, and other life changing events happen to you, there is a feeling that overcomes you.  This feeling brings positive thoughts and it is almost like a force overcoming you. </p>
                 <p>Yes, there are events and times in life that can challenge the positive feeling of love.  However, the force of love is powerful enough to overcome adversity and one must remain strong in the positive beliefs of the universe.</p>

                 <h2 class="artHeadText">Peace is Love</h2>

                 <p>
                     Peace is not something you can touch.  However, Peace is something you can feel and see.  Peace is a derivative of love.  Where there is love there is peace.  It is possible to love without peace, which is a questionable fact.  Since love can be a feeling and possibly an addiction to something that is not positive, it may not bring you peace.
